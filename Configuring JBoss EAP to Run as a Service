Configuring JBoss EAP to Run as a Service

The startup script and an associated configuration file are located in the EAP_HOME/bin/init.d/ directory. 
Open jboss-eap.conf in a text editor and set the options for your JBoss EAP installation.

There are several options in jboss-eap.conf file, but at the minimum you must provide the correct values for JBOSS_HOME and the JBOSS_USER.

You can customize the other options provided in the configuration file by uncommenting and editing the respective lines. If you do not, 
the service will default to starting a standalone JBoss EAP server using the default configuration file, standalone.xml.

#sudo cp EAP_HOME/bin/init.d/jboss-eap.conf /etc/default

#sudo cp EAP_HOME/bin/init.d/jboss-eap-rhel.sh /etc/init.d
#sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/jboss-eap-rhel.sh

#sudo chkconfig --add jboss-eap-rhel.sh

#sudo service jboss-eap-rhel start

#sudo chkconfig jboss-eap-rhel.sh on
